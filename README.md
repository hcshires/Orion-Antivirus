# Orion Antivirus | Henry Shires

A file-based antivirus that contains a list of MD5 hashes from known malware, compares them with a selected file, and determines if it's malware. The user first browses for a file scan, then Orion Antivirus will automatically determine if it is infected. The user then has the option to delete the file from the computer (clean files will not be able to be deleted).

## Features

- Relatively fast scanner algorithm
- Complete deletion of infected files
- Simple, modern, and easy-to-use interface
- Real-time logging of scan data in the UI

The Algorithm consists of generating an MD5 hash checksum for the user's file and comparing it with a list of known malware MD5 hashes in a text file. This program is open source and free to download and use on Windows machines with .NET 4.6.1 or higher.
